            <p id="testomonial1">This is a really good book. It opens your eyes about what it was like as a kid during WW2. Learning about what is was like before a Jew was living with her and after is crazy. People's lived were changed forever because of it. I recommend this book to everyone, no matter the interests. 4/5 stars.</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 15px; "id="testomonial2">Wow! This one is very very good. Two sides to this story. One about a kid whose parents are high up in the Nazi ranks, to the point where they are meeting Hitler. The other about a boy who is in a concentration camp. The story is how the 2 meet and it's crazy. 5/5 stars.</p>
