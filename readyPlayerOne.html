            <p id="testomonial1">This is one of my favorite books I've ever read! It has so many references to video games and movies that are popular today. It's very modern, with a lot of different technologies being made, while some technology we already know. Reading this book made me want to do VR all the time. 5/5 stars.</p>

            <p id="testomonial2">A great book about overcoming bullying about being the odd one out. If you like video games and space this is a great book for you. Essentially another, "if you were in a video game book" but this time with aliens. You can get injected with nanites so you can level up! I'm giving this 4/5 stars</p>
